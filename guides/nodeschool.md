# NodeSchool

NodeSchool is an open source curriculum that teaches Node.js through adventures that run in your terminal. While these adventures are self-guided, don't hesitate to seek help from a wizard if at all necessary.

Also, this guide is a work in progress, if you find a problem with it, please [make an issue](https://github.com/ioschool/) .

## Getting started

To get started, you first need [to install Node.js](/install). Once you have Node.js, use npm (it comes with Node.js) to install the adventure you want to start. Once the adventure is installed, simply type the adventure's name to launch.

You will also need a **Text Editor**. If you don't have one already, you may want one for editing code. A few options: [Atom](http://www.atom.io/), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), [Light Table](http://lighttable.com/), [Textmate](http://macromates.com/download), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).
